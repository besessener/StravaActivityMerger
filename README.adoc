= Setup

== Get Strava API specification

To get the spec, simply run the Gradle task `downloadStravaApi`. You can do this either directly in IntelliJ or with `./gradlew downloadStravaApi` on command line.

== Generate OpenAPI client code

Unfortunately the Groovy support is really poor for Swagger/OpenAPI, so it's required to generate Java code. But since it is generated  code and shall not be touched, it doesn't really  matter.
To generate use the IntelliJ plugin. Simply open `build/generated/strava-api-definition/api.json` and in the Editor click on the edit button:

image::docs/openapi-generate-edit.png[]

And there set the settings as below:

image::docs/openapi-generate-edit-dialog.png[]

It is important to choose the correct path (according to gradle settings it is `src-api`) and to set the correct generator version --> The generator will be downloaded automatically.

OR! just run Gradle task `build` to get everything properly generated.

== Install NodeJS

In order to run the Angular frontend, you need to install NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
and run 

```
npm install
npm install @angular/cdk
npm install -g karma-cli
```

in the repository.

= run it

For local purpose no special deployment is required.

But you need a secret file (`src/main/resources/.secrets`) with content which is not allowed to be shared:

```JSON
{
    "client_id": "<your id>",
    "client_secret": "<your client secret>",
    "google_api_key": "<your api key>"
}
```

Just run:

* `./gradlew bootRun` to start the backend services
* `cd web-app` and `ng serve --open` to open the web UI in your browser

Done.

= How it looks

You can login to Strava with OAuth, no additional credentials required.

As soon as you are authorized, a table view will open, showing your most recent activities. Clicking on a row will show details and a map.

image::docs/table.gif[]

You can select multiple rows/activities with the checkboxes at the left side. Whenever you have 2 or more activities selected, the `merge` button will become active. Clicking on `merge` might take some seconds (~8s) before the table is reloaded and shows the new activity. Merged activities get a noticeable pink border.
